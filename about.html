          <p> Why did I create this application? I want to improve upon our team communication through an open platform
          available 24/7. </p>
          <p class="dark"> This platform gives us the opportunity to acknowledge issues that otherwise may have gone un-noticed.
          Every piece of information received will be reviewed and disscussed to find the best solution. To begin feedback navigate to the

          <p> Just as important as resolving issues and identifying store struggles is recognizing
          the potential to build upon culture. I hope to encourage everyone to leave feedback on what you'd like
          to see added, removed and/or changed from this website to make it the best experience possible. Rolling with
          these positive vibes, I would like to see ideas for team activities such as trips, cook-offs, game nights, etc...</p>
