          <p> Thanks for visiting! Evoice-exp.com will be an on going project with myself and the help of you guys.
            My intentions are to grow our store culture by giving all of you the oppurtunity to voice anything from
            constructive feedback for leadership to ideas for the next fundraiser, store event, competition etc... all
            as frequently or infrequently as you deem necessary. Feel free to leave me feedback on this application
            through the contact form via "Submission" tab.
